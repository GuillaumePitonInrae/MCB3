#  MCBÂ³ (Modeling of Clogging by Boulders of Barriers and Bridges)
Large boulders can jam in constrictions, both for natural geological features (e.g. canyons) and man-made structures (e.g. slit-dams, bridges). Boulder jamming occurs stochastically, and partially governs the outflow rate of geophysical material. Explicit hydro-mechanical models of flows and boulders are unsuitable for studying this stochasticity given their prohibitive computational demands.

This software is an extension of the Cheekye model (see https://github.com/GuillaumePitonInrae/CheekyeDebrisFlowBarrier). It applies expert estimates of a multi-phase flows upstream of several constrictions to a simple model of fluid and boulders interacting with these cascading constrictions. Each constriction can comprise multiple arbitrarily-sized and arbitrarily-placed sub-openings. The model uses a simple statistical method to stochastically compute the presence of boulders that might obstruct the opening(s) and later propagate them to the next contrictions with various hypotheses. The program then gives simple descriptions of flow characteristics near the constrictions, including the flow level over time, and the outlet discharge rate and volume. The model runs quickly (5-30 s per run), allowing uncertainty propagation analyses of interactions between flows, boulders and constrictions.
